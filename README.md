### Hi reader ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mario, an Engineer based in Germany, who likes to play with sensors, code, and some times artistic creations (although Science is art, isn't it?)

In Mexico I used to play in a (locally famous) rock band as a kid :guitar:, worked in a prison, and wrote in a political magazine, before moving to Germany to study Robotics and work in different Start-ups.

Coding in Python :snake: has taken my time recently, although my first love was C++. I also had some affairs with other languages, but I'm not that polyamorous.

Open Source is the way to go, and I will try to support it one way or another.

Currently playing with...

- :artificial_satellite: Inertial Sensors.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Science.
- :video_camera: Computer Vision.
- :robot: ROS.

Learning...

- :computer: Edge AI.
- :love_you_gesture: German Sign Language.
- :taco: Mexican Cuisine.

You can write me in Spanish, English, or German. And if you're in town, hit me up for a chat and a drink in a Biergarten.
