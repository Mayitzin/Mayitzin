### Hi reader ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mario, an Engineer based in Munich, Germany, who plays with sensors, code, and some times artistic creations (although Science is art, isn't it?)

Open Source is the way to go, and I will try to support it one way or another.

Currently playing with...

- :artificial_satellite: Inertial Sensors.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Science.
- :video_camera: Computer Vision.
- :robot: ROS.

Learning...

- :computer: Edge AI.
- :love_you_gesture: German Sign Language.
- :taco: Mexican Cuisine.

You can write me in Spanish, English, or German (and maybe Dutch). And if you're in town, hit me up for a drink in a Biergarten.
