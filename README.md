### Hi reader ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mario, a Mexican Engineer based in Munich, Germany, who plays with sensors, code, and some times artistic creations (although Science is art, isn't it?)

Open Source is the way to go, and I will try to support it one way or another.

Currently playing with...

- :artificial_satellite: Inertial Sensors.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Science.
- :video_camera: Computer Vision.
- :robot: ROS.

Learning...

- :computer: Edge AI.
- :love_you_gesture: German Sign Language.
- :taco: Mexican Cuisine.

You can write me in Spanish, English, or German (and maybe Dutch). And if you're in town, hit me up for a chat and a drink in a Biergarten.
